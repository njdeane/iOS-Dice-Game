// to create IBO (interface builder object) hold down control on UI component in storyboard and drag to the top but inside of view controller class. I can then use this connection to change things with code upon screen load.

// to get the image icons above was typing "image literal" i can then select the image i want to show on loadup from the image options that appear (which come from images i have in side Assets.

// the alpha property i have above is xcode speak for opacity.
